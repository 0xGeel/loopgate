## Who is LoopGate for?

### L2 Creators üßëüèª‚Äçüé®

- Creators can use LoopGate to provide benefits to their community. It can be used to configure unique content that only holders of specific L2 NFTs should have access to. This is known as **'token-gating'**.
- Examples of token-gated content could be **Blog Posts**, **Videos** , **Downloadable (3D) Assets**, and even **(Web) Games**. Your imagination is the limit!

### Collectors üôã

- Collectors can visit the LoopGate website to access token-gated content. They can connect their crypto wallet to the website to verify their ownership.
- If their wallet contains NFTs that should unlock content, LoopGate will display links to that content, allowing access.
