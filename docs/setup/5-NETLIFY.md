  Netlify account. This makes any changes you make publish to your domain.

### **2. Configure**

Congratulations, any changes you push to the `main` branch on your GitHub repository will be sent to Netlify!

However, there is still one important step: adding the environment secrets to Netlify. Here's how you do that:

1. Go to your project's the 'env' settings of your project's Netlify page: [https://app.netlify.com/sites/YOUR_PROJECT_NAME/settings/env](https://app.netlify.com/sites/YOUR_PROJECT_NAME/settings/env)
2. Click on 'Add a variable', then 'import from a .env file'.
3. Copy the contents of your `.env` file, and paste them in the input field. Click on 'Import variables'.
4. Once more, check the `/api/helpers/checkEnvStatus` endpoint to see if all secrets are defined. Your site should be live soon at [https://YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.netlify.app/api/helpers/checkEnvStatus](https://YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.netlify.app/api/helpers/checkEnvStatus)

{% hint style="info" %}
Your Netlify website will most likely have an auto-generated name like '[https://adjective-noun-12345.netlify.app](https://adjective-noun-12345.netlify.app)'. You can easily change the domain name in Netlify!
{% endhint %}
