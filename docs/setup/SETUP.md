## 1. Forking the project

1. Log in with your Github account.
2. Go to [LoopGate's GitHub page](https://github.com/0xGeel/loopgate) and click on **'Fork'** > **'Create a new fork'**. This will create a copy of the project that you can edit.

4. Open your preferred code editor ([I recommend VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).
5. In the start menu, click on **Clone Git Repository** and paste the link you just copied.
6. Select where you'd like to save your project, and open the project. (I like to keep my files in _/desktop/dev/_).

It should look a little like this:
