# Current status

This project is **in active development** ðŸš€.

- The foundation is in place: âœ…
  - Integrating a `web3 provider` to allow users to connect with their wallet (`WalletConnect`, `GameStop/Metamask/Injected`).
  - Accessing the `Loopring API` to retrieve the connected user's held NFTs.
  - Accessing the `Pinata Submarine API` to unlock submarined files based on the admin-specified `config.ts`.

Next steps may include:

- âœ… ~~Auth, client-side & server-side sessions.~~
- Documentation for others on how to use this.
- Individual pages for unlockables.
- Requiring user's Loopring sig to use Loopring API.
